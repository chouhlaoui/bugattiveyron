<p>Bugatti resumed its production in September 2005 to build the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 in Molsheim, on the brand’s historic site. To achieve this, the Volkswagen Group – which, thanks in particular to Ferdinand Piëch, made the revival of the French manufacturer possible – had a new, human-sized, oval-shaped factory built, known as “the Atelier.”</p>
    <h1>Bugatti, Where the Automobile Becomes Art</h1>
Bugatti embodies a unique vision of the automobile, standing at the crossroads of art, engineering, and performance. More than a car manufacturer, it is a myth shaped by rolling masterpieces, bold innovations, human drama, and spectacular rebirths.
<h1>Ettore Bugatti, the Artist‑Engineer
</h1>
    Founded in 1909 in Molsheim by Ettore Bugatti, who came from a family of artists, the brand was built on a clear philosophy: a car must be as beautiful as it is efficient. Every mechanical component was designed as a work of art, giving Bugatti its unmistakable identity.
<h1>The Type 35, a Racing Legend</h1>
    Unveiled in 1924, the Type 35 became the most successful racing car in history. Combining lightness, reliability, technical innovation, and elegance, it perfectly represents Ettore Bugatti’s ideal: performance elevated by design.
<h1>The Royale, Ultimate Excess</h1>
In the 1930s, Bugatti pushed luxury to its limits with the Type 41 Royale. Created for Europe’s royal elite, this extraordinary limousine—produced in only six units—remains a symbol of absolute refinement and one of the most valuable cars ever built.
<h1>Tragedy and Decline</h1>
The death of Jean Bugatti in 1939, designer of the legendary Type 57 Atlantic, marked a brutal turning point. World War II and the death of Ettore Bugatti in 1947 led to the gradual disappearance of the brand, which fell into decades of dormancy.
<h1>A Failed Comeback: the EB110
</h1>
    In the early 1990s, Bugatti briefly returned with the EB110, a technologically revolutionary supercar. Despite its exceptional performance, an unfavorable economic context caused the project to fail, and the brand once again faded away.
<h1>Volkswagen and the Rebirth of the Myth
</h1>
    At the end of the 1990s, the Volkswagen Group revived Bugatti with a clear ambition: to make it the ultimate showcase of automotive technology. Launched in 2005, the Veyron 16.4 pushed all limits by combining extreme power, record-breaking speed, and limousine-level comfort, restoring Bugatti to the pinnacle of global prestige.
